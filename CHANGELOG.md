## [1.1.0] - 2025-05-19

### Added
- âœ¨ **Export Feature**:
  - Introduced `TAMChartExport` utility class.
  - Enables capturing the TAM Chart as a PNG image using `RepaintBoundary`.
  - Supports saving images on mobile/desktop (file system) and downloading on web via blob URLs.
  - Integrated into the example app with a floating export button for one-tap download.

### Updated
- ðŸ”„ **Directional Circle Animation Logic**:
  - The chart's drawing animation now aligns with the specified `somPosition`.
  - Instead of always starting from the top, the circle now begins and ends its animation from the appropriate edge.
    - Example: If `somPosition` is set to `top`, the circle starts drawing from the top. If it's `left`, the animation begins from the left, and so on.
  - This makes the animation behavior more intuitive and consistent with the chartâ€™s layout configuration.
- ðŸ’« Enhanced the smoothness and precision of circular animations for a more fluid visual experience.
